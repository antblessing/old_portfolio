            <h4>More About Me.</h4>
            <p>I have been playing and competing in chess for close to 15 years and it never gets boring! When thinking about what I wanted for my career, I came upon programming and instantly fell in love with its analytical and problem solving nature.  I took a 36 week intensive programming bootcamp that taught me how to apply my knowledge to real life web applications.  </p>
            <p>Now, I take every opportunity I can to learn new things related to web development and computer science from data structures and algorithms to practicing coding problems.</p>

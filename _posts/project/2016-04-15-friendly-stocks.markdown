FriendlyStocks is a social media/stock tracker web application built with Ruby on Rails. Bootstrap is used for the front-end styling as well as some jQuery for additional features, such as the spinner when loading a search result.

As a user, you can search for stocks and get up-to-date stock prices with a stock's acronym.  Additionally, you can add up to 10 stocks to your profile so friends can view the stocks you are following.  

I wanted to gain experience working with a search bar, along with accessing API data from Yahoo's stock API.
